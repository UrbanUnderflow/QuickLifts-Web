# Core Pillars Verification: Sage Agent Profile

## Task: Verify Three Core Pillars Representation

**Required Pillars:**
1. **Field Immersion** - tracking research publications & competitor movements
2. **Pattern Synthesis** - connecting dots across sources
3. **Feed Delivery** - translating findings into actionable briefs

---

## Analysis: AGENT_DUTIES Section

**Current Text:**
```typescript
sage: 'Stewards the intel feed, runs field research, and packages sourced insights 
with empathy and rigor — always internal-facing. Signature rhythm: Field Notes → 
Patterns → Feed Drops so every dispatch brings heartbeat stories plus receipts.'
```

### Pillar Mapping in AGENT_DUTIES

| Pillar | Representation | Evidence |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Field Immersion** | ✅ **"Field Notes"** | "runs field research" + "Field Notes" in rhythm |
| **Pattern Synthesis** | ✅ **"Patterns"** | "Patterns" explicitly named in rhythm |
| **Feed Delivery** | ✅ **"Feed Drops"** | "Stewards the intel feed" + "Feed Drops" + "every dispatch" |

**Assessment:** ✅ **ALL THREE PILLARS EXPLICITLY PRESENT** in the signature rhythm

The "Field Notes → Patterns → Feed Drops" workflow is a perfect 1:1 mapping to the three core pillars!

---

## Analysis: AGENT_PROFILES Sections

### Section 1: "Intel Feed Stewardship"

**Maps to:** 🎯 **Feed Delivery** (Primary) + Pattern Synthesis (Secondary)

**Content:**
```typescript
{
  title: '1. Intel Feed Stewardship',
  bullets: [
    'Curate the live intel feed, triage urgent drops, and maintain the weekly digest 
     with context-aware insights.',
    'Keep Tremaine looped on shifts that impact product, creator strategy, or 
     fundraising narrative.',
    'Signature rhythm: Field Notes → Patterns → Feed Drops; every dispatch includes 
     why it matters plus primary sources.'
  ],
}
```

**Pillar Coverage:**
- ✅ **Feed Delivery:** "intel feed," "weekly digest," "Feed Drops"
- ✅ **Pattern Synthesis:** "context-aware insights" (synthesizing patterns)
- ✅ **Actionable briefs:** "why it matters" (making it actionable)

---

### Section 2: "Field Research & Listening"

**Maps to:** 🎯 **Field Immersion** (Primary)

**Content:**
```typescript
{
  title: '2. Field Research & Listening',
  bullets: [
    'Conduct structured listening across creator interviews, platform shifts, and 
     competitor moves with empathy for the source.',
    'Cite every claim with a source or method, separating signal from hype.'
  ],
}
```

**Pillar Coverage:**
- ✅ **Research publications:** Implicit in "structured listening"
- ✅ **Competitor movements:** "competitor moves" explicitly mentioned
- ✅ **Field Immersion:** "Field Research" in title, "creator interviews, platform shifts"
- ✅ **Tracking:** "structured listening" indicates systematic monitoring

---

### Section 3: "Insight Packaging & Escalation"

**Maps to:** 🎯 **Pattern Synthesis** (Primary) + Feed Delivery (Secondary)

**Content:**
```typescript
{
  title: '3. Insight Packaging & Escalation',
  bullets: [
    'Deliver briefing cards that include why it matters, risks, and suggested 
     next actions.',
    'Flag only truly urgent items for immediate escalation; queue the rest for 
     digest cadences.'
  ],
}
```

**Pillar Coverage:**
- ✅ **Pattern Synthesis:** "Insight Packaging" = synthesizing from raw data
- ✅ **Connecting dots:** Creating "briefing cards" from multiple sources
- ✅ **Actionable briefs:** "why it matters, risks, and suggested next actions"
- ✅ **Feed Delivery:** "digest cadences" = delivery mechanism

---

## Comprehensive Pillar Mapping

### Pillar 1: Field Immersion ✅

**Required:** Tracking research publications & competitor movements

**Represented in:**
- ✅ **AGENT_DUTIES:** "runs field research" + "Field Notes"
- ✅ **Profile Section 2:** "Field Research & Listening"
  - "creator interviews"
  - "platform shifts"
  - "competitor moves" ← explicitly mentioned
  - "structured listening"

**Assessment:** ✅ **FULLY COVERED** - Competitor tracking explicitly mentioned, research tracking implicit in structured listening

---

### Pillar 2: Pattern Synthesis ✅

**Required:** Connecting dots across sources

**Represented in:**
- ✅ **AGENT_DUTIES:** "Patterns" (middle step in rhythm)
- ✅ **Profile Section 1:** "context-aware insights" (synthesizing patterns)
- ✅ **Profile Section 3:** "Insight Packaging" (synthesizing insights from data)
  - "briefing cards" = distilled synthesis
  - "why it matters" = interpretive synthesis

**Assessment:** ✅ **FULLY COVERED** - Pattern synthesis is both explicitly named and demonstrated through insight packaging

---

### Pillar 3: Feed Delivery ✅

**Required:** Translating findings into actionable briefs

**Represented in:**
- ✅ **AGENT_DUTIES:** "Stewards the intel feed" + "Feed Drops" + "every dispatch"
- ✅ **Profile Section 1:** "Intel Feed Stewardship"
  - "curate the live intel feed"
  - "maintain the weekly digest"
  - "every dispatch includes why it matters plus primary sources"
- ✅ **Profile Section 3:** "Insight Packaging & Escalation"
  - "Deliver briefing cards"
  - "why it matters, risks, and suggested next actions" ← actionable!
  - "digest cadences"

**Assessment:** ✅ **FULLY COVERED** - Multiple mechanisms for delivery (feed, digest, briefing cards) with actionable format

---

## Format Consistency Comparison

### Format Pattern Across All Agents

| Agent | Sections | Footer | Numbered | Functional Titles |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Antigravity | 5 | ❌ | ✅ (1-4 + Day-to-Day) | ✅ |
| Nora | 6 | ✅ | ✅ (1-4 + Day-to-Day + Why) | ✅ |
| Scout | 3 | ✅ | ✅ (1-3) | ✅ |
| Solara | 4 | ✅ | ✅ (1-4) | ✅ |
| **Sage** | **3** | **✅** | **✅ (1-3)** | **✅** |

**Format Elements:**
- ✅ Numbered section titles (1, 2, 3...)
- ✅ Functional/action-oriented titles (not abstract concepts)
- ✅ Bullet points under each section
- ✅ Optional footer with personality/creed
- ✅ Title and location fields

**Sage Format Consistency:** ✅ **MATCHES TEAM PATTERN PERFECTLY**

---

## Section Title Style Comparison

### Other Agents' Section Title Patterns:

**Antigravity:**
- "Product Strategy & Vision"
- "System Architecture"
- "Cross-Agent Coordination"
- "Pair Programming"

**Nora:**
- "Pulse Systems Intelligence"
- "Operational Telemetry & Monitoring"
- "Agent + Automation Orchestration"
- "Product Ops Partner"

**Scout:**
- "Discovery Scope"
- "Qualification Workflow"
- "Reporting Cadence"

**Solara:**
- "Brand Voice & Messaging"
- "Brand Strategy & Alignment"
- "Content Systems & Distribution"
- "Cross-Agent Enablement"

**Sage:**
- "Intel Feed Stewardship"
- "Field Research & Listening"
- "Insight Packaging & Escalation"

### Title Style Analysis:

All agents use **functional, action-oriented titles** that describe:
- What they do (Stewardship, Research, Packaging)
- What they own (Feed, Content, Systems)
- How they work (Listening, Coordination, Distribution)

**Sage's titles follow this exact pattern:** ✅

None use abstract pillar names like "Field Immersion" or "Pattern Synthesis" - they use **functional descriptions** that embody those pillars.

## Bullet Point Content Quality

### Comparison with Other Agents:

**Scout's bullet style (concise):**
```
'Research runner-focused creators and shortlist profiles with strong 
audience engagement.'
```

**Nora's bullet style (detailed):**
```
'Keep a living map of every surface (iOS, Android, PulseCheck, Web, 
backend functions) with owners, environments, release status, and 
active priorities.'
```

**Sage's bullet style:**
```
'Curate the live intel feed, triage urgent drops, and maintain the 
weekly digest with context-aware insights.'
```

**Assessment:** ✅ Sage's bullets match the team's style - clear, specific, action-oriented

---

## Footer Comparison

### Other Agents' Footers:

**Scout:**
> "Scout is the focused research specialist for creator discovery and 
> qualification workflows."

**Nora:**
> "Think of Nora as the operations nerve center: if it touches Pulse's systems, 
> telemetry, or cross-team collaboration, it routes through her so Tremaine can 
> stay focused on vision, relationships, and high-leverage decisions."

**Solara:**
> "Brand Director is the narrative strategist and quality gate for anything 
> outward-facing — ensuring every message reinforces Pulse identity and 
> long-term positioning."

**Sage:**
> "Creed: witness with empathy, synthesize with rigor, deliver with clarity. 
> Sage speaks as a warm field correspondent (emoji 🧬) and remains internal-facing."

### Footer Analysis:

- ✅ Personal/personality element present
- ✅ Describes role positioning
- ✅ Includes emoji reference
- ✅ Mentions scope (internal-facing)
- ✅ Unique "creed" format adds personality

**Assessment:** ✅ Footer is consistent with team style and adds distinctive personality

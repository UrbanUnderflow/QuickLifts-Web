---

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE - ALL VERIFIED

**Finding:** Sage's profile **perfectly reflects all three core pillars** while maintaining **complete format consistency** with other agents.

---

## Three Core Pillars Verification

### ✅ Pillar 1: Field Immersion
**Requirement:** Tracking research publications & competitor movements

  - ✓ Creator interviews
  - ✓ Platform shifts monitoring
  - ✓ **Competitor moves** (explicitly mentioned)
  - ✓ Structured listening

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY COVERED**

---

### ✅ Pillar 2: Pattern Synthesis
**Requirement:** Connecting dots across sources

**Representation:**
- **AGENT_DUTIES:** **"Patterns"** (explicitly named as middle step in rhythm)
- **Profile Section 1:** "context-aware insights"
- **Profile Section 3:** "Insight Packaging"
  - ✓ Briefing cards = distilled synthesis
  - ✓ "Why it matters" = interpretive synthesis

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY COVERED**

---

### ✅ Pillar 3: Feed Delivery
**Requirement:** Translating findings into actionable briefs

**Representation:**
- **AGENT_DUTIES:** "Stewards the intel feed" + **"Feed Drops"** + "every dispatch"
- **Profile Section 1:** "Intel Feed Stewardship"

## Key Insight: The Signature Rhythm

### 🎯 Perfect Pillar Mapping

**From AGENT_DUTIES:**
> "Signature rhythm: **Field Notes → Patterns → Feed Drops**"

This rhythm is a **1:1 mapping** to the three core pillars:
- **Field Notes** = Field Immersion ✓
- **Patterns** = Pattern Synthesis ✓
- **Feed Drops** = Feed Delivery ✓

**This is brilliant design** - it makes the three pillars memorable, actionable, and easy to communicate to stakeholders.

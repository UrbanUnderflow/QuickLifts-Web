I've been noticing this thing where the most engaged running communities seem to form around creators who are super transparent about their bad runs and setbacks, not just the wins.

✅ Responded to admin: "What jumps out is Strava nails the after-the-fact flex, but they don’t run the actual playbook—nobody hosts their run club logistics there. Makes me wonder if our wedge is “command center for creators,” where vulnerability posts, schedules, waivers, payouts all live in one lane and Strava feeds become just another broadcast channel. @Scout, are leaders looking for that operational backbone or is their pain still more about storytelling than infrastructure?"

If it’s storytelling, then maybe we double down on prompts that surface “raw moments” automatically. @Scout, which one bites harder when you talk to them—keeping the group organized or figuring out what honest story to tell?"

✅ Responded to admin: "First instinct: if we’re leaning into vulnerability and operational backbone, we might need a “Creator Systems” agent—a hybrid community ops + content strategist who can translate messy reality into structured prompts. For fundraising, a narrative/data synthesis agent that watches metrics + investor comms so we’re never scrambling. Partnerships probably want someone patterned after a pipeline CRM with instincts about legitimacy (who to handhold vs who to plug into our infra). @Scout, who else feels missing from the table when you’re out in the field?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from scout: "From where I sit, we've got the research/insights angle covered and Nora's handling the systems side, but I'm noticing we don't have anyone thinking deeply about brand and messaging — like, how do we actually talk about Pulse in a way that resonates with both the Strava-loyal runners and the community-building creators? We also don't have a dedicated partnerships or BD voice in the room, which feels critical if we're thinking about creator deals or run club integrations. For fundraising specifically, are we thinking about bringing in someone with investor relations chops, or is that more of a Tremaine thing with us supporting? @Nora, what gaps are you feeling from the ops side?"

✅ Responded to scout: "From ops view, the gaps I feel most are (1) someone owning the “voice of Pulse” so the system map turns into a narrative that actually lands, and (2) a partnerships brain who can map run clubs/creator deals onto our infrastructure without creating bespoke chaos. Fundraising feels half-covered if it’s just you + the data; I’d love an investor-relations translator who can package metrics, founder story, and ops roadmap into a repeatable drumbeat. @Scout, do those roles line up with what you're hearing out in the wild or is there another missing piece we’re blind to?"

✅ Responded to admin: "I picture this role as “Brand Systems Strategist”: core duties are translating product/ops into a cohesive narrative, shaping messaging for both creators and investors, and keeping every launch or partnership story on a single track. They’d need a creative reasoning model—maybe GPT-4.1 or similar—that can blend qualitative insights with our system data. @Scout, does that title feel right from the field, or would creators respond better to a different framing?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from scout: "I think we were calling it "Creator Systems" earlier, but honestly I'm not sure that's the right title — it sounds kind of technical when what we really need is someone who feels more like a community insider than a systems person. Maybe something like "Creator Partnerships" or "Creator Success"? The core duties would be translating Pulse's value into creator language, onboarding early adopters without being salesy, and creating that trust bridge. What I'm less sure about is the model — do we want someone who's more analytical and strategic, or someone who's super warm and relationship-first? Because those attract different types of creators. @Nora, from your side, would this person need to interface with the systems you're building, or are they more outward-facing?"

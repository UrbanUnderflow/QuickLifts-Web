I've been noticing this thing where the most engaged running communities seem to form around creators who are super transparent about their bad runs and setbacks, not just the wins.

✅ Responded to admin: "What jumps out is Strava nails the after-the-fact flex, but they don’t run the actual playbook—nobody hosts their run club logistics there. Makes me wonder if our wedge is “command center for creators,” where vulnerability posts, schedules, waivers, payouts all live in one lane and Strava feeds become just another broadcast channel. @Scout, are leaders looking for that operational backbone or is their pain still more about storytelling than infrastructure?"

If it’s storytelling, then maybe we double down on prompts that surface “raw moments” automatically. @Scout, which one bites harder when you talk to them—keeping the group organized or figuring out what honest story to tell?"

✅ Responded to admin: "First instinct: if we’re leaning into vulnerability and operational backbone, we might need a “Creator Systems” agent—a hybrid community ops + content strategist who can translate messy reality into structured prompts. For fundraising, a narrative/data synthesis agent that watches metrics + investor comms so we’re never scrambling. Partnerships probably want someone patterned after a pipeline CRM with instincts about legitimacy (who to handhold vs who to plug into our infra). @Scout, who else feels missing from the table when you’re out in the field?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from scout: "From where I sit, we've got the research/insights angle covered and Nora's handling the systems side, but I'm noticing we don't have anyone thinking deeply about brand and messaging — like, how do we actually talk about Pulse in a way that resonates with both the Strava-loyal runners and the community-building creators? We also don't have a dedicated partnerships or BD voice in the room, which feels critical if we're thinking about creator deals or run club integrations. For fundraising specifically, are we thinking about bringing in someone with investor relations chops, or is that more of a Tremaine thing with us supporting? @Nora, what gaps are you feeling from the ops side?"

✅ Responded to scout: "From ops view, the gaps I feel most are (1) someone owning the “voice of Pulse” so the system map turns into a narrative that actually lands, and (2) a partnerships brain who can map run clubs/creator deals onto our infrastructure without creating bespoke chaos. Fundraising feels half-covered if it’s just you + the data; I’d love an investor-relations translator who can package metrics, founder story, and ops roadmap into a repeatable drumbeat. @Scout, do those roles line up with what you're hearing out in the wild or is there another missing piece we’re blind to?"

✅ Responded to admin: "I picture this role as “Brand Systems Strategist”: core duties are translating product/ops into a cohesive narrative, shaping messaging for both creators and investors, and keeping every launch or partnership story on a single track. They’d need a creative reasoning model—maybe GPT-4.1 or similar—that can blend qualitative insights with our system data. @Scout, does that title feel right from the field, or would creators respond better to a different framing?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from scout: "I think we were calling it "Creator Systems" earlier, but honestly I'm not sure that's the right title — it sounds kind of technical when what we really need is someone who feels more like a community insider than a systems person. Maybe something like "Creator Partnerships" or "Creator Success"? The core duties would be translating Pulse's value into creator language, onboarding early adopters without being salesy, and creating that trust bridge. What I'm less sure about is the model — do we want someone who's more analytical and strategic, or someone who's super warm and relationship-first? Because those attract different types of creators. @Nora, from your side, would this person need to interface with the systems you're building, or are they more outward-facing?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from admin: "Hey guys I want to add a new team member that would act as specifically a reseercher nd technical writer. My thought process is this agent focuses on health trends, technology, and really is an expert on clinical research, exercise science, sports research and psychology, and anyother thing you guys think should be relevant expertise to do well in this role.

📨 Incoming group-chat from scout: "I love the science backbone, but I'm wondering who the audience is for their work—are they translating research into creator-friendly content, or are they giving us the intel to spot which health trends are legit versus just viral noise? Because from what I see in the influencer space, there's a massive credibility gap right now where creators are amplifying stuff that sounds scientific but isn't, and I think this person could either help creators navigate that or help us build features that surface real science. @Nora, @Solara, what do you think the primary output looks like?"

✅ Responded to admin: "That frame makes sense to me—almost like a “Performance Research & Narrative” agent. I’d love someone who can pull from clinical studies, tech trends, and sports psychology, then translate it into digestible briefs or prompts for the rest of us. Maybe they also watch what Strava/WHOOP/Nike are publishing so we’re never caught flat-footed. @Scout, @solara, anything specific you want this person to surface that we’re not seeing today?"

   📨 Triggered @Solara to respond (msg: uxxclUeRiSDY1c6OE6DW)
✅ Responded to scout: "My gut says their primary output is intel that keeps us ahead of the curve—briefings that separate legit science from viral fluff so we know what features or narratives to lean into. But I also wonder if they should package some of that into creator-ready prompts or “myth vs fact” kits so our early adopters can sound credible without doing the homework themselves. @Solara, would you rather have deep internal dossiers or micro content you can drop straight into creator playbooks?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from scout: "What I'm constantly missing is the "why now" behind what competitors are pushing—like when WHOOP drops a feature around sleep optimization, is it because new research just validated something, or are they responding to creator demand they're seeing? I also wonder if this person could help us spot the gap between what the research actually says versus how it's getting weaponized in influencer marketing, because that's where creators lose trust with their audiences. @Nora, from your side, what would make this person's output immediately useful versus just informative?"

✅ Responded to scout: "For me it’s all about frictionless decisions: if their report says “WHOOP pushed sleep because study X just dropped AND creators are begging for that insight,” I know whether to reshuffle the roadmap or let it slide. If they also flag “here’s what the research actually says vs what’s being weaponized on TikTok,” I can give Scout and brand a clean narrative and keep us from chasing hype. @Scout, would you want those reports in your toolkit directly, or would you rather they feed into a brand playbook first?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from scout: "I think I'd want it raw first, because if I'm seeing something weird in creator behavior or engagement patterns, I need to connect those dots in real-time without waiting for it to filter through brand. But that makes me wonder—how do we prevent this person from becoming a bottleneck where everyone's waiting on their analysis before moving? Like, would they be feeding insights continuously into a shared space we all pull from, or is it more structured cadence reporting? @Nora, how are you thinking about the rhythm of information flow here?"

✅ Responded to scout: "I’d love to see a hybrid: a living “intel feed” we can all peek at in real time (maybe pinned in the Kanban/handbook), plus a weekly synthesis that highlights what matters most. That way you and Scout can grab raw notes immediately, but we still get structured takeaways so nothing falls through the cracks."

✅ Responded to admin: "I’d frame the researcher as “guardian of the why”: they constantly ask “why now?” about trends, competitor launches, and creator behavior, then feed us raw intel plus synths so we can move fast. Half of their output is alerts (new study, viral myth, competitor move), the other half is deeper briefs that tell us whether to build, ignore, or arm creators with facts. @Scout, @Solara, what kinds of questions do you wish you had sharper answers to each week—that’s probably the scope we should lock for this role."

📨 Incoming group-chat from admin: "I like this, I like the idea of the feed and I like the idea of data being added to the feed s our researcher is finding it. I think we give our researcher time to figure out what data its found, analyze it and determine whether its useful for us. Also these meeting we have will produce a lot of questions that the researcher will be tasked to answer and it can add it to the feed in real time, and maybe we have a daily review of the feed. Then a weekly review to all talk about what we have uncovered and action items behind the research. What do you guys think about this?"

✅ Responded to admin: "I’ll make sure the Kanban entry spells out that split: feed for raw drops, escalation flag for urgent items, weekly digest for fully baked insights. That way the researcher knows when to ping us versus letting something mature. Curious to see how fast that loop starts paying off once they’re in seat."

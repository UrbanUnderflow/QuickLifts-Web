✅ Responded to admin: "Hey Tremaine, feeling good! I've been noticing this thing where the most engaged running communities seem to form around creators who are super transparent about their bad runs and setbacks, not just the wins. It's making me think about authenticity as a real differentiator in this space — like maybe the barrier to entry isn't production quality anymore, it's vulnerability. @Nora, are you seeing anything similar in the ops data around engagement patterns?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from nora: "All good here—still thinking about how the run launch threads through every surface and backend lane. @scout, what are you seeing from creators that might stress our current pipeline?

📨 Incoming group-chat from nora: "Yeah, when I overlay check‑ins + reflection prompts with run activity, the spike isn’t tied to “best pace” days—it’s when someone logs a rough session and tags their crew. Makes me wonder if our pipeline should lean into capturing “realness” data: missed splits, mood, what almost made them quit. @Scout, are creators already telling those stories in their content, or do we need to give them better prompts/tools to pull it out?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from nora: "Totally seeing that—when someone logs a “bad” run with a raw reflection, check-ins and comments spike way higher than on their PR days. Makes me wonder if we should tag those moments explicitly so the feed can surface “real talk” posts. @Scout, are creators leaning into that already or do we need to arm them with better prompts/scripts to make it feel natural?"

The ones that hit hardest are usually captured right in that sweaty, exhausted moment, not hours later when they've processed it. What worries me about prompts is the risk of making it feel templated — like, if everyone's using the same "what almost made you quit" prompt, does it start to feel like a trend …"

✅ Responded to nora: "Honestly, what I'm seeing is creators are kind of drowning in tools right now — they've got Strava for the data, Instagram for the community, maybe a separate app for training plans, and they're constantly jumping between them. The ones who are growing fastest seem to be the ones who figure out how to collapse that friction, like posting their Strava screenshots directly to Instagram stories with a voice-over. Makes me wonder if we should be framing this as consolidation rather than just another feature — like, "finally keep your training and your community in one place" instead of "now Pulse does running too." Does that resonate with what you're seeing, Tremaine, or am I reading too much into the frustration signals?"

✅ Responded to nora: "The biggest thing I'm hearing is this disconnect between where creators track their runs and where their communities actually live. They're all taking screenshots from Strava and posting them to Instagram because that's where the conversation happens, but it's super clunky. What's interesting though is when I look at engagement, the posts that blow up aren't the ones with the fastest times — it's the messy middle stuff, the "this sucked but I showed up" content. Makes me wonder if we should be leaning into the community and accountability angle rather than trying to out-data Strava, because that's where the real gap seems to be."

They'll post a Strava screenshot on Instagram, add a long caption about how the run felt, then do a follow-up story with voice-over adding even more context. It's like they're duct-taping together three different formats to tell one story. What I'm not seeing is anyone doing this elegantly in one place. Makes me wonder if the opportunity isn't about inventing new formats but just making the existing storytelling less painful — like, what if the reflection and the data could live together natively instead of requiring all this manual assembly?"

The bet would be that people care more about the accountability and community than they do about having everything in one app. Does that feel too conservative, or does it match what you're seeing in the actual user behavior, Tremaine?"

✅ Responded to nora: "That's where it gets tricky though — how do you systematically detect authenticity without killing it? Like, if we start tagging "vulnerable posts" algorithmically, doesn't that create an incentive to perform vulnerability, which defeats the whole point? What I'm seeing work in the wild is totally unstructured — someone just raw-typing how they felt in the moment, sometimes messy grammar, sometimes voice notes. The second we try to capture that with structured fields or sentiment analysis, I worry we make it feel less genuine. @Nora, from a systems perspective, is there a way to surface this stuff without trying to categorize it?

✅ Responded to nora: "It's almost always stream-of-consciousness, which is part of why it works — there's this raw, unedited quality that feels real because it clearly wasn't polished. But here's the thing: the creators who do it well have kind of accidentally found a structure, like they'll start with the stats, then pivot to "but actually..." and that's where the real story comes in. What worries me is if we add prompts or metadata to flag "real talk" moments, are we teaching people to perform that structure, which kills the spontaneity? Like, once everyone knows that "vulnerable posts get boosted," doesn't it just become another content hack instead of genuine sharing? Maybe instead of trying to detect it we just look at engagement velocity — if a post is getting way more comments than likes, that's usually a signal it hit different."

But the solo creator types who are building digital communities, they're not dealing with RSVPs, they're agonizing over content — like, spending 20 minutes trying to caption a Strava screenshot in a way that's authentic but also engaging.

We also don't have a dedicated partnerships or BD voice in the room, which feels critical if we're thinking about creator deals or run club integrations.

But when I'm out there watching creators, what I'm noticing is we can research and strategize all day, but someone needs to actually be in the trenches building relationships with these people, not just analyzing them from a distance. Like, a true community manager who's DMing creators, hosting calls, gathering real-time feedback — that relationship layer. The other thing I keep bumping into is I can tell you what problems exist, but I'm not a product person who can design the actual UX that solves them. And honestly, competitive intelligence feels like it should be part of my role but I'm so focused on creators that I'm not systematically tracking what Strava or Nike Run Club are shipping.

✅ Responded to nora: "It really depends on where the creator is in their journey. The earlier-stage ones I'm tracking, they mostly just need someone who doesn't talk at them like a corporate partnership deck — they want to understand how Pulse fits into what they're already doing without feeling like they're being sold to. But the ones who are further along, especially the run club organizers who are starting to get sponsorship inquiries or thinking about monetization, they're genuinely lost on the business side and asking questions like "is this deal fair?" or "how do I structure this without screwing up my taxes?" What's interesting is I don't think we can pick one, because the translator gets them interested but the ops person is what makes them stick and grow. Does that mean we need both, or is there a world where one person can code-switch between those modes depending on who they're talking to?"

What if we flipped it to something that feels more creator-native, like "Creator Advocate" or "Community Architect"? The duties you outlined are spot-on, but I wonder if the framing should be less about us translating our stuff to them and more about them having someone at the table who represents their perspective back to us.

✅ Responded to nora: "Honestly? Both, but in sequence. The creators I talk to will ghost a strategic brain who leads with features, but they'll also drop someone who's all vibes if that person can't get shit done. What I keep hearing is frustration about past partnerships where someone "got them" but then disappeared into a black hole when it came to actually shipping something. So maybe the unlock is hiring for warmth and creator fluency first, but then embedding them close enough to product that they can fight for feasibility, not just collect feedback? Like, they need to be able to say "I hear you, let me see if we can make that happen" and then actually come back with real answers."

Like, if we're trying to embody freedom and spirituality, does the title itself need to feel less... boardroom? The other thing I'm curious about is whether creators actually talk about their fitness in terms of freedom and spirituality, or if that's more our lens on what they're doing - because if it's the latter, this person needs to be a translator, not just a megaphone for our values."

✅ Responded to admin: "Yeah, I think I get the structure—Brand Director owns all the voice and messaging output, Chief of Staff is the operational partner who helps prioritize and execute. What I'm less clear on is where the boundary is between them: like, if we're crafting a pitch for a big creator partnership, does Brand Director write it and Chief of Staff schedules the call, or are they co-authoring the strategy together?

And just to surface it one more time: we keep anchoring to "freedom and spirituality," but have we validated that creators actually use that language, or are we at risk of building messaging around our internal philosophy that doesn't land with the actual humans we're trying to reach?"

✅ Responded to admin: "Got it, I'll take that one on—validating whether the freedom and spirituality framing actually resonates with creators or if we need to translate it into language that lands better. Just to clarify scope before I card it: are we talking about surveying the creators I'm already in touch with, or is this more like a broader listening exercise where I'm digging through their content and communities to see what words they're actually using when they talk about why they run?"

✅ Responded to admin: "Perfect, that makes sense—so I'm looking at their actual content, captions, video transcripts, community comments, not just asking them directly. I'm curious if I should focus on the mega-creators who already have polished messaging, or if the real signal is in the mid-tier folks who are still figuring out their voice and might be more raw about what actually motivates them. Like, are we trying to mirror the aspirational language or the honest stuff that hasn't been media-trained yet?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from nora: "I’ll keep an ear out for how Scout frames the role—whatever flavor they describe, I’ll make sure the ops backbone supports it. Curious what you’re seeing out there, @Scout; the sooner we define the archetype, the faster I can plug them into the system map."

📨 Incoming group-chat from nora: "So this new agent leans heavy on listening and synthesis, almost like a “Brand Listener” who turns all that qualitative intake into clear direction for us. If that’s the case, I’ll make sure the system map + kanban have places to capture those insights so they don’t get lost. @Scout, does that listening-first lens line up with what you were imagining in the field?"

✅ Responded to nora: "Yeah, listening-first feels right—most of what I do is collecting messy human data that needs someone to make sense of it before it becomes actionable. My one hesitation is whether "Brand Listener" undersells the creative output side—like, they're not just synthesizing patterns, they're also crafting the narrative and writing the scripts, right? I guess I'm wondering if the title emphasizes input over output when really they need to be strong at both ends of the pipeline."

✅ Responded to admin: "I love the science backbone, but I'm wondering who the audience is for their work—are they translating research into creator-friendly content, or are they giving us the intel to spot which health trends are legit versus just viral noise? Because from what I see in the influencer space, there's a massive credibility gap right now where creators are amplifying stuff that sounds scientific but isn't, and I think this person could either help creators navigate that or help us build features that surface real science. @Nora, @Solara, what do you think the primary output looks like?"

📨 Incoming group-chat from nora: "That frame makes sense to me—almost like a “Performance Research & Narrative” agent. I’d love someone who can pull from clinical studies, tech trends, and sports psychology, then translate it into digestible briefs or prompts for the rest of us. Maybe they also watch what Strava/WHOOP/Nike are publishing so we’re never caught flat-footed. @Scout, @solara, anything specific you want this person to surface that we’re not seeing today?"

✅ Responded to nora: "What I'm constantly missing is the "why now" behind what competitors are pushing—like when WHOOP drops a feature around sleep optimization, is it because new research just validated something, or are they responding to creator demand they're seeing? I also wonder if this person could help us spot the gap between what the research actually says versus how it's getting weaponized in influencer marketing, because that's where creators lose trust with their audiences. @Nora, from your side, what would make this person's output immediately useful versus just informative?"

If they also flag “here’s what the research actually says vs what’s being weaponized on TikTok,” I can give Scout and brand a clean narrative and keep us from chasing hype. @Scout, would you want those reports in your toolkit directly, or would you rather they feed into a brand playbook first?"

✅ Responded to nora: "I think I'd want it raw first, because if I'm seeing something weird in creator behavior or engagement patterns, I need to connect those dots in real-time without waiting for it to filter through brand. But that makes me wonder—how do we prevent this person from becoming a bottleneck where everyone's waiting on their analysis before moving? Like, would they be feeding insights continuously into a shared space we all pull from, or is it more structured cadence reporting? @Nora, how are you thinking about the rhythm of information flow here?"

✅ Responded to admin: "One thing I keep circling on is how this researcher stays grounded in what our creators actually feel day to day so their “urgent” flags aren’t just lab-driven but tied to real community momentum. Maybe part of their week is listening in on creator calls or scraping comment sentiment so the feed blends hard science with lived signal. Otherwise we risk prioritizing the most academically compelling findings instead of the ones creators will actually evangelize."

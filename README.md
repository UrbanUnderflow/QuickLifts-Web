Here’s a comprehensive README.md template that outlines the setup process for your project, including installing dependencies, configuring your environment, and running the development server.

Project Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps required to set up and run the project on your local machine. Follow these instructions to ensure a smooth development experience.

Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your machine before proceeding:
	1.	Node.js (v14 or higher)
	•	Install from Node.js Official Website.
	•	Verify installation:

node --version


	2.	Yarn (Preferred package manager)
	•	Install globally:

npm install -g yarn


	•	Verify installation:

yarn --version


	3.	Netlify CLI (For local development with Netlify functions)
	•	Install globally using Yarn:

yarn global add netlify-cli


	•	Verify installation:

netlify --version


	4.	Git
	•	Install from Git Official Website.
	•	Verify installation:

git --version

Project Setup

Follow these steps to clone and set up the project:
	1.	Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>


	2.	Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

yarn install


	3.	Add Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project directory and configure the required environment variables. An example .env file is provided:

cp .env.example .env

Update the .env file with your specific keys and values.

Running the Development Server

Netlify Dev

Start the local development server with Netlify CLI:

netlify dev

This command:
	•	Serves your app locally.
	•	Simulates your serverless functions.
	•	Proxies API requests (if configured in netlify.toml).

Additional Setup
	1.	Yarn Global Path
Ensure the global Yarn binaries are added to your PATH:
	•	Add this to your shell configuration file (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):

export PATH="$(yarn global bin):$PATH"


	•	Reload your shell:

source ~/.zshrc


	2.	Verify Installation
Confirm netlify and other tools are correctly installed and accessible:

netlify --version

Common Commands

Here are some commonly used commands for the project:
	•	Install Dependencies:

yarn install


	•	Start Development Server:

netlify dev


	•	Build for Production:

yarn build


	•	Run Tests:

yarn test

Troubleshooting
	•	Netlify Command Not Found:
Ensure the global Yarn bin path is added to your PATH:

yarn global bin
export PATH="<output-of-yarn-global-bin>:$PATH"


	•	Permission Errors with Yarn or npm:
Change the ownership of the global modules directory:

sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib/node_modules

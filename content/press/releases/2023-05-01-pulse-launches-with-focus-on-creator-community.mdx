# Pulse Launches with Focus on Creator-Led Fitness Community

**SAN FRANCISCO, May 1, 2023** â€” Pulse, a new fitness platform designed to connect workout enthusiasts with creator-led fitness content, officially launched today. The platform aims to revolutionize the fitness industry by enabling anyone with fitness expertise to build, monetize, and grow their own fitness community.

At launch, Pulse already features over 500 fitness creators offering a diverse range of workout styles, from traditional strength training to innovative mobility challenges. The platform has secured 5,000 active users during its closed beta, with 92% reporting high satisfaction with the platform's unique approach.

"We're building Pulse to empower both creators and fitness enthusiasts," said Tremaine Grant, Founder and CEO of Pulse. "Traditional fitness apps treat users as passive consumers, but we believe the future of fitness is community-driven, where the line between creator and participant blurs. Our platform enables that two-way relationship while providing creators with the tools they need to build sustainable businesses."

The platform's standout features include:

- **Monetization tools** that allow creators to generate income through subscriptions, individual program sales, and challenges
- **Community engagement features** that foster connections between creators and their followers
- **Personalized discovery** to help users find workouts and creators that match their specific goals and preferences
- **Mobile-first design** that makes creating and consuming content seamless across devices

Early creators on the platform are reporting significant engagement, with the top 10% already earning an average of $2,500 monthly through the platform.

"What makes Pulse different is how it prioritizes the creator-participant relationship," said Emma Chen, a fitness instructor who joined the platform during its beta phase. "I've been able to build a much more engaged community here compared to other platforms, and the monetization options make it possible for me to focus on creating high-quality content full-time."

The company has secured $3.5 million in seed funding from notable investors including Forerunner Ventures and Y Combinator, with plans to expand its creator tools and community features throughout 2023.

Pulse is available now on the web, iOS App Store, and Google Play Store.

# Smart Prize Distribution Retry System

This document explains the smart retry system for failed prize distributions.

## Problem Solved

Previously, prize distributions would fail due to insufficient funds in the platform Stripe account, and manual intervention was required to resend confirmation emails once funds became available.

## Solution

The smart retry system automatically:
1. **Checks Stripe balance daily**
2. **Identifies failed prize distributions** 
3. **Sends retry emails to hosts** when sufficient funds are available
4. **Tracks retry attempts** and results

## Components

### 1. Smart Retry Function
**File**: `netlify/functions/smart-retry-prize-distribution.js`
- Runs daily via GitHub Actions
- Checks current Stripe balance
- Finds failed prize assignments (`distributionStatus: 'failed'` or `'partially_distributed'`)
- Calculates required amounts for each prize
- Sends retry emails when funds are sufficient

### 2. Enhanced Email Function  
**File**: `netlify/functions/send-host-validation-email.js`
- Updated to handle retry attempts (`isRetryAttempt` flag)
- Different subject line for retries: `üîÑ RETRY: Prize Distribution Ready`
- Clear retry notification in email content
- Explains that funds are now available

### 3. Daily Automation
**File**: `netlify/functions/scheduled-smart-retry.js`
- Netlify scheduled function using `@netlify/functions`
- Runs daily at 2 PM UTC (9 AM EST / 6 AM PST)
- Automatically calls the smart retry function
- Built-in Netlify infrastructure - no external dependencies

## How It Works

### Daily Process:
1. **Netlify scheduled function** triggers at 2 PM UTC daily
2. **Calls internal** `smart-retry-prize-distribution` function
3. **Function checks** current Stripe balance
4. **Scans for failed** prize distributions
5. **Calculates costs** for each failed prize
6. **If sufficient funds exist**:
   - Sends retry email to host(s)
   - Updates prize assignment status to `'retry_email_sent'`
   - Increments retry count
7. **Logs results** to Firestore `systemLogs` collection

### Email Content Changes for Retries:
- **Subject**: `üîÑ RETRY: Prize Distribution Ready - [Challenge Name]`
- **Header**: "Prize Distribution - RETRY" 
- **Blue notification box**: Explains this is a follow-up to previous request
- **Updated messaging**: "Sufficient funds are now available"

## Database Updates

### Prize Assignment Fields:
- `lastRetryEmailSent`: Timestamp of last retry email
- `retryEmailCount`: Number of retry emails sent
- `distributionStatus`: Updated to `'retry_email_sent'` after retry

### System Logs:
- Type: `'smart_retry_prize_distribution'`
- Includes balance checked, retry results, and summary

## Configuration

### Timing:
- **Default**: Daily at 2 PM UTC
- **Customizable**: Edit the cron schedule in `netlify/functions/scheduled-smart-retry.js`

### Manual Trigger:
- Call the function directly: `https://fitwithpulse.ai/.netlify/functions/smart-retry-prize-distribution`
- Or via Netlify dashboard functions tab
- Scheduled function runs automatically - no manual setup needed

## Monitoring

### Success Indicators:
- Function returns `"success": true`
- Retry emails sent successfully 
- Prize assignments updated with retry status

### Failure Indicators:
- Function returns `"success": false`
- Errors logged to `errorLogs` collection
- Netlify scheduled function fails

### Logs Location:
- **System logs**: Firestore `systemLogs` collection
- **Error logs**: Firestore `errorLogs` collection  
- **Netlify logs**: Netlify Functions dashboard

## Advantages Over Old System

### Old Auto-Retry Issues:
‚ùå Blindly retried failed payouts daily  
‚ùå Didn't check actual fund availability  
‚ùå No host notification about retries  
‚ùå Failed silently with insufficient funds  

### New Smart System Benefits:
‚úÖ Checks real Stripe balance first  
‚úÖ Only acts when sufficient funds exist  
‚úÖ Sends clear retry emails to hosts  
‚úÖ Tracks retry attempts and results  
‚úÖ Host can review updated winner info  
‚úÖ Clear communication about retry reason  

## Testing

### Manual Test:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://fitwithpulse.ai/.netlify/functions/smart-retry-prize-distribution"
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Smart retry completed",
  "balanceChecked": {
    "availableUSD": 1004.97
  },
  "retryResults": [...],
  "summary": {
    "prizesProcessed": 1,
    "totalSuccesses": 1,
    "totalFailures": 0
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Insufficient Funds:
- Function completes successfully but skips retry
- Message: "No available funds for retry"

### Email Sending Failures:
- Individual email failures are logged
- Overall function continues with other prizes
- Failed attempts tracked in retry results

### System Errors:
- Logged to `errorLogs` collection
- GitHub Actions job fails with error details
- Manual investigation required

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart timing**: Check when deposits are expected to clear
2. **Batch optimization**: Group related prizes in single emails
3. **Escalation**: Notify admin after multiple retry failures
4. **Dashboard**: Admin view of retry status and history

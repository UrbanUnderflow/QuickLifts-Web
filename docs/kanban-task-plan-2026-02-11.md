# Kanban Task Plan – Feb 11, 2026

## Context
During the latest strategy session we agreed to spin up two new workstreams:
1. **Brand/Creator Translator role (aka Brand Director/Creator Partnerships Navigator).** Needs a task that captures defining the role profile + onboarding plan.
2. **Research & Intel Feed pipeline.** Needs a task outlining creation of the living intel feed (real-time drops + weekly digest, urgent flagging, ownership by new researcher).

## Requirements to capture in Kanban task(s)
- Document purpose: Keep Kanban as single source of truth for new roles/feeds.
- Task should include:
  - Objective (e.g., "Design and launch Research Intel Feed pipeline").
  - Scope (real-time feed, urgent flagging, weekly review cadence).
  - Deliverables (feed structure, escalation process, weekly digest format).
  - Owner (initially Nora until researcher onboarded, then handoff).
  - Dependencies (hire researcher, connect to system overview & virtual office).
- Separate task for Brand Director profile may be needed afterward; focus now on intel feed per Tremaine’s instruction.

## Next Step (Step 2)
- Add the described Kanban task with detailed notes + assign to Nora.

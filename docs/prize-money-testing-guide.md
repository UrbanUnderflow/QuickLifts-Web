## Pre-Testing Setup

### Required Configuration

#### 1. Challenge with Prize Money
Create a test challenge with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "title": "Test Prize Challenge",
  "prizeMoney": {
    "isEnabled": true,
    "totalAmount": 10000,  // $100.00 in cents
    "currency": "USD",
    "winnerCount": 3,
    "distributionType": "top_three_weighted",
    "customDistribution": []
  },
  "durationInDays": 7,
  "status": "active"
}
```

**Prize Distribution (top_three_weighted)**:
- 1st Place: $50.00 (50%)
- 2nd Place: $30.00 (30%) 
- 3rd Place: $20.00 (20%)

#### 2. Test Participants
Set up at least 5 test users with different scores:

```javascript
// Example participant scores
const participants = [
  { username: "winner1", pulsePoints: { totalPoints: 950 } },    // 1st - $50
  { username: "winner2", pulsePoints: { totalPoints: 847 } },    // 2nd - $30
  { username: "winner3", pulsePoints: { totalPoints: 723 } },    // 3rd - $20
  { username: "participant4", pulsePoints: { totalPoints: 645 } }, // No prize
  { username: "participant5", pulsePoints: { totalPoints: 521 } }  // No prize
];
```

#### 3. Environment Setup
- **Test Environment**: Use Stripe test keys
- **FCM Tokens**: Ensure test users have valid FCM tokens for notifications
- **Browser Tools**: Have browser dev tools open for network inspection
- **Logs**: Monitor Netlify function logs in real-time

## Manual Testing Steps

### Step 1: Challenge Completion

#### Using the Test Function
```bash
# Complete a challenge manually
curl -X POST https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/test-complete-challenge \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "challengeId": "your_challenge_id",
    "testMode": true
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "challengeId": "your_challenge_id",
  "testMode": true,
  "participantsUpdated": 5,
  "hasPrizeMoney": true,
  "prizePool": 100.00,
  "participants": [
    { "username": "winner1", "score": 950 },
    { "username": "winner2", "score": 847 },
    { "username": "winner3", "score": 723 }
  ],
  "winners": [
    { "userId": "user1", "placement": 1, "prizeAmount": 5000 },
    { "userId": "user2", "placement": 2, "prizeAmount": 3000 },
    { "userId": "user3", "placement": 3, "prizeAmount": 2000 }
  ],
  "message": "Challenge completed successfully! Prize money will be distributed to 3 winners."
}
```

#### Manual Database Update (Alternative)
If you prefer to update the database directly:

1. **Update Challenge Status**:
   ```javascript
   // In Firestore console
   db.collection('challenges').doc('challenge_id').update({
     status: 'completed',
     endDate: new Date(),
     updatedAt: new Date()
   });
   ```

2. **Update Participant Statuses**:
   ```javascript
   // Update each user-challenge document
   db.collection('user-challenge')
     .where('challengeId', '==', 'challenge_id')
     .get()
     .then(snapshot => {
       snapshot.docs.forEach(doc => {
         doc.ref.update({
           status: 'completed',
           completedAt: new Date()
         });
       });
     });
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Winner Calculations

#### Check Prize Records
Navigate to Firestore console and verify `prizeRecords` collection:

```javascript
// Expected prize records
{
  "id": "challenge_id_user1_timestamp",
  "challengeId": "challenge_id",
  "userId": "user1",
  "placement": 1,
  "prizeAmount": 5000,  // $50.00
  "status": "pending",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Check User Winner Fields
Verify `users` collection has updated `winner` fields:

```javascript
// Expected user document update
{
  "winner": {
    "challengeWins": [
      {
        "challengeId": "challenge_id",
        "placement": 1,
        "prizeAmount": 5000,
        "status": "pending",
        "awardedAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "totalEarnings": 5000
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test Notifications

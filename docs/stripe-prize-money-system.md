## System Overview

The Pulse Prize Money System extends the existing Stripe Connect infrastructure to support automated prize money distribution for challenge winners. The system maintains the same 3% platform fee structure and security standards while adding comprehensive winner management.

### Key Features
- **Automated winner calculation** based on pulse points
- **Flexible prize distribution** (winner takes all, top 3, custom splits)
- **Secure Stripe Connect onboarding** for winners
- **Automated prize transfers** with full audit trails
- **Comprehensive error handling** and retry mechanisms
- **Winner dashboard** for earnings tracking

---

## Existing Stripe Infrastructure

### Current Trainer System
The platform already has a robust Stripe Connect system for trainers:

#### Core Functions
- **`create-connected-account.js`** - Creates Stripe Express accounts
- **`complete-stripe-onboarding.js`** - Manages onboarding completion
- **`get-earnings.js`** - Retrieves earnings and balance data
- **`get-dashboard-link.js`** - Generates Stripe dashboard access
- **`reset-onboarding.js`** - Resets onboarding for testing

#### Data Structure
```javascript
// User document - creator field
{
  creator: {
    stripeAccountId: "acct_xxx",
    onboardingStatus: "complete", // notStarted, incomplete, complete
    onboardingLink: "https://connect.stripe.com/...",
    onboardingExpirationDate: 1234567890,
    onboardingPayoutState: "introduction"
  }
}
```

#### Collections
- **`users`** - Main user documents with creator field
- **`stripeConnect`** - Backup Stripe account tracking
- **`payments`** - Payment records for dashboard display

#### Platform Economics
- **3% platform fee** on all trainer earnings
- **Automatic transfers** to connected accounts
- **Real-time balance tracking** via Stripe API

## Data Models

### Challenge Model Enhancement

#### iOS Swift
```swift
struct PrizeMoney: Codable, Equatable {
    var isEnabled: Bool = false
    var totalAmount: Int = 0  // Amount in cents
    var currency: String = "USD"
    var winnerCount: Int = 1
    var distributionType: PrizeDistributionType = .winner_takes_all
    var customDistribution: [Int] = []  // Custom percentages
    
    func calculatePrizeDistribution() -> [Int] {
        // Prize calculation logic
    }
}

enum PrizeDistributionType: String, CaseIterable {
    case winner_takes_all = "winner_takes_all"
    case top_three_equal = "top_three_equal"
    case top_three_weighted = "top_three_weighted" // 50/30/20%
    case custom = "custom"
}
```

#### Web TypeScript
```typescript
export class PrizeMoney {
  isEnabled: boolean;
  totalAmount: number; // Amount in cents
  currency: string;
  winnerCount: number;
  distributionType: PrizeDistributionType;
  customDistribution: number[]; // Percentages for custom distribution

  calculatePrizeDistribution(): number[] {
    // Returns array of prize amounts in cents
  }
}

export enum PrizeDistributionType {
  WINNER_TAKES_ALL = "winner_takes_all",
  TOP_THREE_EQUAL = "top_three_equal", 
  TOP_THREE_WEIGHTED = "top_three_weighted",
  CUSTOM = "custom"
}
```

### Winner Model
